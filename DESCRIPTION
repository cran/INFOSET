Description: Estimation of the most-left informative set of gross returns 
             (i.e., the informative set).
             The procedure to compute the informative set adjusts the method 
             proposed by 
             Mariani et al. (2022a) <doi:10.1007/s11205-020-02440-6> 
             and 
             Mariani et al. (2022b) <doi:10.1007/s10287-022-00422-2> 
             to gross returns of financial assets. 
             This is accomplished through an adaptive algorithm
             that identifies sub-groups of gross returns in 
             each iteration by approximating their distribution with a
             sequence of two-component log-normal mixtures. 
             These sub-groups emerge when a significant change
             in the distribution occurs below the median of the 
             financial returns, with their boundary termed as
             the â€œchange point" of the mixture. 
             The process concludes when no further change points are detected.
             The outcome encompasses parameters of the leftmost mixture 
             distributions and change points of the
             analyzed financial time series.
